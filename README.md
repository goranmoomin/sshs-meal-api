# SSHS Meal API

This is a microservice that returns the meal menu of SSHS.
It's based on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (although I like the `now` naming better).

## Initial setup

Clone this repository: 

``` shellsession
$ git clone https://github.com/pcr910303/sshs-meal-api.git
$ cd sshs-meal-api
```

and install all dependencies:

``` shellsession
$ yarn
```

Start the development server:

``` shellsession
$ now dev
```

[The API](http://localhost:3000) will run on port 3000 of localhost.

## Deploying

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) makes deploying very easy.
It's just one command:

``` shellsession
$ now
```

I deploy this to https://sshs-meal-api.pcr910303.vercel.app, you might want to use the API.
